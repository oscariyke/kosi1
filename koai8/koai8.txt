I am excited to apply for the Cybersecurity Analyst posi�on at Lockheed Mar�n, as 
adver�sed on Company Website. With 10 years of experience in safeguarding 
systems and networks from cyber threats, coupled with my exper�se in threat 
detec�on, penetra�on tes�ng, ethical hacking, networking technology, AWS 
management administrator, I am eager to contribute to your team’s mission of 
protec�ng cri�cal infrastructure and ensuring a secure digital environment.   
In my role as a Cybersecurity Analyst at Bank of America and TD Bank, I 
successfully "reduced incident response �me by 25% by implemen�ng real-�me 
monitoring with Splunk, and Qualys scanning tools. I conducted vulnerability 
assessments, iden�fied risks, and collaborated with cross-func�onal teams to 
deploy remedia�on strategies that strengthened organiza�onal security posture. 
My experience with Wireshark, Nessus, CrowdStrike, and frameworks like NIST 
and ISO 27001 enables me to tackle evolving cyber threats effec�vely. 
One of my proudest accomplishments was leading a phishing awareness campaign 
that decreased successful atacks by 30% through employee training and 
simulated exercises. This experience honed my ability to blend technical exper�se 
with ini�a�ve-taking communica�on, a skill I believe aligns with Lockheed 
Mar�n’s commitment to innova�on, and customer trust. 
I hold CompTIA Security+ and Cer�fied Ethical Hacker (CEH) cer�fica�ons, which 
have deepened my understanding of ethical hacking and incident response. I am 
especially atracted to Lockheed Mar�n due to its esteemed reputa�on for 
pioneering cybersecurity solu�ons and its commitment to safeguarding sensi�ve 
informa�on within the Informa�on Technology sector. I am confident that my 
technical proficiency, analy�cal mindset, and passion for cybersecurity will make 
me a valuable addi�on to your team. 
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align 
with Lockheed Mar�n’s needs. Thank you for considering my applica�on. I am 
available at the above-men�oned phone number or email address and look 
forward to the possibility of contribu�ng to your organiza�on’s success.
